## Reflection

  This is month long projet i made during my college years. It may look like simple on the surface but it touches so many things like implementing relationships between users, products and orders. Plus the implementation of payment gateways.
  
  Developing the project was fun and challenging i ran into problems when implementng paypal api since it was new to me at that point, but find a way by reading the docs.
  
  I decide which language/framework to use in backend. but i decided to use nodejs with express since it is my prefered backend language and framework.
  
  Medium size projects to big projects is where frontend frameworks shines. I use React with redux to build the frontend. Its really easy building frontends with react compare to HTML and vanila js.

  Overall, building this ecommerce project was fun. I am now knowledgeable in building ecommerce sites. I look forward in making this a multi seller ecommerce when i have the time.
